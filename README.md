# AdaGPT GitHub Action
AdaGPT is an AI-powered GitHub Action that generates helpful responses to comments on issues and pull requests. It's like having a conversation with ChatGPT, but without actually leaving GitHub and available to everyone.

Simply mention [@AdaGPT](https://github.com/AdaGPT) in your comments on issues and pull requests. AdaGPT will be activated and respond to your comment with a helpful response.

## Who's Ada?
Ada is named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), a pioneer of computer programming and the first person to write an algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Ada is considered the first computer programmer and a symbol of women's contributions to science and technology.

## Getting Started
To use AdaGPT, you'll need to create an OpenAI API key and add AdaGPT to your workflow. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) if you don't already have one. Keep in mind that you'll occur charges for using the API.
2. Save your OpenAI API key as a [Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in your repository.
3. Create a new workflow in folder `.github/workflows` that will be executed for [new comments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#issue_comment) on issues and pull requests.

### Workflow
```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/adagpt.yml
name: 'AdaGPT'

# Execute the workflow on new issue comments
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

# Allows the workflow to create comments on issues and pull requests
permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  issue_comment:
    # Only run the job if the comment contains @AdaGPT (this will also be checked implicitly by the action again)
    if: ${{ github.event.comment && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@AdaGPT') }}    
    name: Issue and PR comments
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3  
      - uses: zirkelc/adagpt@v1
        name: AdaGPT
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          openai_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}
          issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
```

Check out [`main.yml`](./.github/workflows/main.yml) for a working demo.

### Permissions
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` requires the following permissions to create comments on issues and pull requests:
- `issues: write`
- `pull-requests: write`

Add these permissions to your workflow or individual jobs using the [`permissions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow) keyword.

### Secrets
Sensitive information, such as the OpenAI API key, should be stored as [encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in the repository.

Add your OpenAI API key as a secret to your repository and reference it using the `${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}` syntax.

## Action Inputs

| Name                 | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github_token`       | Yes      |         | The access token used to retrieve and create comments on the issues and pull requests. This will typically be your GitHub token. If so, use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`                                                                                                                                                 |
| `issue_number`       | Yes      |         | The number of the issue or pull request. If the workflow was triggered on the `issue_comment` event, use `${{ github.event.issue.number }}`                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `openai_key`         | Yes      |         | The API key used for OpenAI chat completion request. Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to create a new API key                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `openai_temperature` | No       | 0.8     | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. See [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#completions/create-temperature) for more information. |     |     |     |     |     |     
| `openai_top_p`       | No       | 0       | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. See [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#completions/create-top_p) for more information.                                     |
| `openai_max_tokens`  | No       | 4096    | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. See [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#completions/create-max_tokens) for more information.                                                                                                                           |
